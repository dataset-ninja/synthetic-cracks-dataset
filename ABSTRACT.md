Obtaining real-world annotated data for crack segmentation can be challenging. The detailed, pixel-perfect nature of segmentation requires extensive labor and often expert knowledge, making the process time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to these challenges. It provides a controlled, cost-effective, and automated alternative to real-world data collection and manual annotation.
