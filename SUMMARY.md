**Synthetic Cracks Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the utilities industry. 

The dataset consists of 1558 images with 1551 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *cracks* and *__bg__*.

Images in the Synthetic Cracks Dataset dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 7 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *cracks synth 7* (1158 images) and *cracks synth 7 styled* (400 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the Supervisely.

Here is the visualized example grid with animated annotations:
