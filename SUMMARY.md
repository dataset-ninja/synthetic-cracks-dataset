**Supervisely Synthetic Crack Segmentation** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the industrial domain. 

The dataset consists of 1557 images with 1550 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*cracks*).

Images in the Supervisely Synthetic Crack Segmentation dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 7 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *synthetic cracks* (1157 images) and *synthetic cracks styled* (400 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the Supervisely.

Here is the visualized example grid with animated annotations:
